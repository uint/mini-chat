# mini-chat

Just a little toy project, mostly to learn Flutter and get a refresher in async Rust. One stone, two birds!

# How to run

Right now, you can run the server with:

```sh
cargo run
```

You can run the client with:

```sh
cd client
flutter run
```

The client is not yet set up to interact with the actual server. That's coming soon!
